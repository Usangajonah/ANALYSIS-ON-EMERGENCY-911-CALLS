## ABOUT PROJECT
Like we all know that emergency is an unforeseen or sudden occurrence which demand immediate remedy or action. At some point, we tend to think more about why some emergency calls are been made and that's the main reason I have decided to perform some analysis on the 911 calls dataset.

## PYTHON LIBRARIES IMPORTATIONS
A library which is a collection of functions that we include in our python code and called as necessary. With libraries, pre-existing functions can be imported which will efficiently expand the code performance. For this project, I will import the following libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn e.t.c. Then set %matplotlib inline since I'm using a Jupiter notebook.

## GETTING DATA 
For this project I will be analysing some 911 (emergency calls) data from Kaggle in Montgomert County Pennsylvania. The data contains the following fields:
* lat : String variable, Latitude  
* lng: String variable, Longitude â€¢ desc: String variable, Description of the Emergency Call
* zip: String variable, Zipcode
* title: String variable, Title
* timeStamp: String variable, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS   
* twp: String variable, Township
* addr: String variable, Address  
* e: String variable, Dummy variable (always 1)
