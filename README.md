## ABOUT PROJECT
Like we all know that emergency is an unforeseen or sudden occurrence which demand immediate remedy or action. At some point, we tend to think more about why some emergency calls are been made and that's the main reason I have decided to perform some analysis on the 911 calls dataset.
